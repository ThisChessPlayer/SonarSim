Generates realistic hydrophone receiver times given specified multiple object
placement. This allows for testing of algorithms and visualization of possible
object locations given receiver locations.

Running program:
   Place sonarSim1_0.py in current directory, type the command:
        python sonarSim1_0

Changelog:
-> V1.0
   Scalable Grid
   -User can generate time table from grid of specified unit increment and size
    in both x and y axes.
   -The region is centered in x axis, but not in y.

   Objects
   -X and Y positions fixed before runtime, objects represented in 2D array.
     -2D array contains x pos, y pos, and 3 receiver times for each object.
   -Receiver times generated during runtime.
   
   Visualization
   -Can print labeled graph of locations in scalable grid with matching 
    receiver times, allowing the user to see where an object could possibly be.
   -Visualization is written to file 'timeTable'.
   -Has option for single object or set of receiver time visualization.
